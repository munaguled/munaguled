Currently learning Linux from the ground up — building tools, scripting in Bash, exploring system security foundations, and running IT networking homelabs to deepen practical skills. Passionate about cybersecurity, automation, and understanding how systems really work under the hood. Also deeply interested in data — exploring patterns, building projects, and turning raw information into insights. Always eager to experiment with new tech and hands-on projects.
