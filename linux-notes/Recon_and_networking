🧠 Recon & Networking Commands (Explained in Detail)

🔎 nmap
What it is:
nmap = Network Mapper. It scans IP addresses or domains to detect live hosts, open ports, running services, and even OS details.
Basic Use Case:
In a CTF, you start with a target IP. Use nmap to map out the digital terrain.
📌 Example:
nmap 10.10.10.10
→ Scans the IP for open ports (default 1–1000).
🔍 nmap -sV
What it is:
-sV = service version detection. It doesn’t just tell you a port is open, it tells you what’s running there (e.g. Apache 2.4.29 on port 80).
Use Case:
Helps you find vulnerable versions of services (e.g. outdated SSH or Apache).
📌 Example:
nmap -sV 10.10.10.10
→ Shows that port 22 is running OpenSSH 7.6p1.
🕵️ nmap -A
What it is:
Aggressive scan. Includes:
OS detection (-O)
Version detection (-sV)
Script scanning
Traceroute
Use Case:
When you're doing deep reconnaissance and need everything nmap can give.
⚠️ Be careful:
Don’t use -A on real targets without permission — it’s noisy.
📌 Example:
nmap -A 10.10.10.10
→ Will tell you the OS type, service versions, and more.
🌐 whois
What it is:
A tool that gets public info about a domain/IP: registrar, contact info, creation date, etc.
Use Case:
In OSINT or domain-based CTFs (subdomain discovery, DNS analysis).
📌 Example:
whois tryhackme.com
→ Will show registrar info, DNS servers, and sometimes emails.
🧭 dig
What it is:
DNS lookup tool. Stands for domain information groper.
Use Case:
When you want to find the IP address behind a domain, or check DNS records (e.g. A, MX, TXT).
📌 Example:
dig tryhackme.com
→ Gives the IP address of the domain.
You can also dig subdomains:
dig admin.tryhackme.com
🔧 nslookup
What it is:
Similar to dig, but older and simpler.
Use Case:
Quick DNS checks, often found on Windows too.
📌 Example:
nslookup tryhackme.com
→ Also shows the IP address and DNS resolver used.
🕳️ nc (netcat)
What it is:
A Swiss army knife of networking. You can:
Connect to ports (client mode)
Open your own ports (listener/server)
Transfer files, chat, exploit backdoors
Use Case:
Check banner info
Interact with services directly
Create reverse shells
📌 Example:
nc 10.10.10.10 80
→ Opens a connection to port 80 (HTTP). You can type raw HTTP requests.
📡 telnet
What it is:
Older than netcat, but useful for talking to ports manually.
Use Case:
Same as nc, but sometimes works better with certain services.
📌 Example:
telnet 10.10.10.10 21
→ Connects to the FTP service on port 21.
🧠 Summary Table

Command	Description	When to Use
nmap	Scan ports	First step of recon
nmap -sV	Get service versions	Identify vulnerabilities
nmap -A	Deep recon	Full fingerprinting
whois	Domain/IP ownership	OSINT on domains
dig	DNS info	Find IPs, subdomains
nslookup	DNS info	Basic DNS lookups
nc	Talk to ports manually	Banner grabbing, reverse shells
telnet	Talk to ports (old tool)	Same as nc but older
